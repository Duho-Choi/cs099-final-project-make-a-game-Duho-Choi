# 4. Conditional Statements

## What is it?
---
Conditional statements checks condition (in round bracket) that is right or wrong. If the condition fulfilled, conditional statement implements the codes we wrote down in braces. But if the condition is wrong wrong, the code will proceed skipping the codes in braces.

Almost all of the actings in the game, including basic acts are worked according to the conditions. Starting the game, finishing the game, also

## How do we use it?
---
In real life, we can't walk through the wall normally. Likewise, when character encounters a wall while moving forward, then we need to wrote down conditional statements that checks character reaches the wall. When character reaches the wall, we have to character should stop moving forward.
Like this way, lots of basic situations could be implemented by conditional statements.
