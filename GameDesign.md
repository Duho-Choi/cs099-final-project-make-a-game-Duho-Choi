## High Concept

### Title : Outlaw of the Galaxy
It is top-view shooting game. In the outer space, player has to survive from surging enemies.

### Survive from Enemy's Attack!
You are running out from the cruel space empire, and spaceships from empire are keep chasing and trying to shoot you. You have to survive from those enemies' chase!

### Upgrade basic stats with your coin
You can get coins when you kill enemies chasing you. There's your Base at the center of map, and you can enter your base to upgrade your ship's health, attack damage, attack rate, armor, and move speed (up to 10 level each) by spend your coins. These helps you to survive more easily. And you can also repair your ship with coins in proportion to ship's damage rate.

### Level Up and Choose your Special Skills
By killing enemies, you can get not only coins but also experience point(exp) that allows you to level up. When level up, you can heal part of your hp for free as a reward. Also, there are total eight special skills that can add to your spaceship. Each time player's level goes up by 3 levels, player can choose one of two given skills(skills will be given randomly). There are some skills that simply upgrades your stat, or have a special gadgets that helps player to survive, or even makes player to kill enemies more easily!

## Theme
---
The given theme of project was "Take one, leave the rest." To 
fulfill this theme, I thought about "Level Up" function to give player to select options of upgrade. There are total eight special skills, and when moment to choose special skill comes, two options among them will be given randomly, and player could choose only one. If player choose one of them, player can't use rest of the skills until he or she restarts game.

## Mock Ups

## Main Menu
There are three buttons; Start, Options, and Credits. When clicking start button, screen passes to help screen which tells player simply about how to play it, and information about game elements. 

### Help screen

## Game screen
In the game screen, there's three noticeable user interfaces that shows some resources in this game: Health Point(HP), Coin, Level and Experience Point. Player can move spaceship with keyboard W,A and D; move forward with W, turn left and right with A and D. Enemies keep spawning permanently if the number of enemy doesn't get over max limit of it.
